Fleet Commander

Fleet Commander is an application that allows you to manage the desktop
configuration of a large network of users and workstations/laptops.

It is primarily targetted to Linux systems based on the GNOME desktop.

Fleet Commander consists on two components:

- a web service integrated with Apache that serves the dynamic application and
  the profile data to the network.
- and a client side daemon that runs on every host of the network.

Fleet Commander relies on libvirt and KVM to generate the profile data
dinamically from a template VM running the same environment as the rest of the
network.

SETUP

These are the instructions to build and install the client daemon:

$ ./configure --prefix=$PREFIX # where $PREFIX can be /usr or /usr/local
$ make
$ make install

CONFIGURATION

You need to specify the Fleet Commander HTTP endpoint where the profile data is
read from in /etc/xdg/fleet-commander.conf, this is an example 

	[fleet-commander]
	source = http://192.168.123.4:8181/clientdata/

After any configuration changes you must restart the daemon:

	# systemctl restart fleet-commander
